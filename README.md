    <strong><a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">TailwindCSS</a></strong> is a <i>utility-first</i> CSS Framework packed with classes. This framework is not only popular but a lot of good feedback after using the framework. Therefore, I am curious to try to use it. In addition, I try to keep the website displayed when it arrives offline with a <strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers">service worker</a></strong> and automates the performance of the website. Actually wanted to add a <strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps">PWA</a></strong> but was still confused because there was a problem <i><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/pwa/installable-manifest/?utm_source=lighthouse&utm_medium=devtools">"Web app manifest or service worker do not meet the installability requirements"</a></i>. Maybe next time yes. For audit results using liight house as follows.
